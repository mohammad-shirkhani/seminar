            "Wainscott was a former railroad station on the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road in Wainscott, New York, United States. It was opened in either 1897 or 1898 by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, rebuilt in 1915 by the LIRR, and closed in 1938.Wainscott station has the distinction of being the only Long Island Rail Road station to have segregated waiting rooms, in spite of the fact that the New York State Legislature never allowed segregated facilities. Some sources claim that another station was segregated, but this has yet to be confirmed. In early 1938, the station was closed due to the effects of the Great Depression, and was moved to a beach, where it has served as a private residence since then.This New York train station–related article is a stub.

            "Blue is the name of four paintings that Georgia O'Keeffe made in 1916. It was one of the sets of watercolors that she made exploring a monochromatic palette with designs that were non-representational of specific objects. The paintings were made on 15+7⁄8-by-11-inch (40.3 cm × 27.9 cm) sheets of Japanese tissue of the gampi tree.Blue No. 2 was made in Virginia before O'Keeffe moved to Texas. One opinion is that through Blue No. II, O'Keeffe expresses her personal experience with music. For instance, the shape is like the curves of the neck of the violin, which she was playing during the timeframe. She could also be suggesting emotion felt through music through the use of line and the intense blue color, perhaps influenced by Wassily Kandinsky. Another viewpoint is that it is similar to the lines in charcoal drawing No. 8 Special made in 1916.\n",

            "Wilhelm von Lenz (born 20 May 1809 in Riga - died 7 January 1883 in Saint Petersburg) was a Baltic German Russian official and writer. Wilhelm von Lenz was a friend and student of many mid-century Romantic composers, including Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin and Hector Berlioz, Lenz's most important and influential work was an early biography of the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven, entitled Beethoven et ses trois styles (1855), written in response to the disparagement of Beethoven by Alexander Ulybyshev in his Nouvelle biographie de Mozart (1843). Lenz promoted the idea (already suggested by earlier figures such as François-Joseph Fétis) that Beethoven's musical style be divided into three characteristic periods. Lenz's periodisation, with minor changes, is still widely used today by musicologists in discussing Beethoven's compositions.This article about a Russian writer or poet is a stub.

Thunbergia on its own usually refers to Thunbergia grandiflora, while Thunbergia alata is often known as black-eyed Susan vine or just black-eyed Susan (not to be confused with other flowers called black-eyed Susan). Orange clockvine is the name of Thunbergia gregorii.Thunbergias are frequent garden escapes, becoming invasive species; T. grandiflora, T. fragrans, and T. laurifolia are considered weeds in Australia.Thunbergia erectaThunbergia fragransThunbergia gregoriiThunbergia laurifoliaThunbergia mysorensis\n",

It was recorded 8 October 1973 at the Boarding House in San Francisco by Owsley Stanley and Vickie Babcock utilizing eight microphones (four per channel) mixed live onto a stereo Nagra tape recorder.  The caricature album cover was illustrated by Greg Irons.  It was, for many years, the top selling bluegrass album of all time.[citation needed] Eventually, however, the soundtrack album for O Brother, Where Art Thou? surpassed its sales.On AllMusic, Peter J. D'Angelo said, \"Soaring multi-part harmonies; fiddle, guitar, banjo, bass, and mandolin lines that seamlessly intertwine with a good-time feel; and exceptionally solid musicianship round out the ten-track effort.... This is the sound of purists re-creating the music they grew up with and it's both enjoyable and inspiring to listen to.\"\n",

The song uses war as a metaphor in describing an argument and eventual reconciliation between a couple, with the woman emerging victorious and the narrator exclaiming, \"Oh, what a sweet surrender!\"  The song begins with the sound of drums mimicking the start of a battle march.  Despite Billy Sherrill's ambitious production and Jones' committed vocal performance, the single did not crack the Top 10, stalling at #16 and continued the singer's commercial slide as a solo artist.  Meanwhile, the single \"Golden Ring,\" a duet with his estranged ex-wife Tammy Wynette, became a #1 hit that same year.\n",

Lenz promoted the idea (already suggested by earlier figures such as François-Joseph Fétis) that Beethoven's musical style be divided into three characteristic periods.

Nevertheless, today virtually any type of meat is suitable for its production, the most common being beef, deer and pork.Aesthetically it looks quite similar to bresaola, but it is produced in much smaller sizes (300-800 g) and has a much stronger flavor due to the aromatization with salt, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, bay leaf and pepper.The charcuterie lasts about a month.This Italian cuisine–related article is a stub.

            "Manfred Noa (22 March 1893 – 5 December 1930) was a German film director. Noa was described by Vilma Bánky, who he directed twice, as her \"favourite director\". Noa's 1924 film Helena has been called his \"masterpiece\" although it was so expensive that it seriously damaged the finances of Bavaria Film.Noa is perhaps best known today for his 1922 film Nathan the Wise, an adaptation of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's 1779 play of the same title, which made a plea for religious tolerance. He was the third husband of the actress Eva May, who was the daughter of his fellow director Joe May. Noa died 5 December 1930 in Berlin of peritonitis.This article about a German film director is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\n",

The town is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area .  The first European to visit the lake was Father Isaac Jogues in August 1642. He was later captured by Mohawks , escaped, and returned home to France . In 1646, he was sent on a political mission to the Iroquois to propose a treaty of peace, and at that point dubbed the lake \"Lac du Saint Sacrement\" (Lake of the Blessed Sacrament) .  In 1755, the lake was renamed \"Lake George\" by General William Johnson , in honor of King George II .  Lake George was also the site of Fort William Henry , named in honor of Prince William Henry , grandson of King George II, by General Johnson. The fort, its surrender to the Marquis de Montcalm after a six-day siege by the French and Indians, and the following massacre all in 1757 were used by James Fenimore Cooper as the background for his famous novel The Last of the Mohicans . The fort was reconstructed and opened to the public as a museum in 1953.  The town was established in 1810 as the \"Town of Caldwell\" from parts of the...\n",

            "Fugging ( German: [ˈfʊgɪŋ] ⓘ ), formerly spelt Fucking until 2021, is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf , located in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria . It is 33 km (21 mi) north of Salzburg and 4 km (2.5 mi) east of the Inn river , which forms part of the German border .  Despite a population of only 106 in 2020, the village has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its former name, which was spelled the same as an inflected form of the vulgar English-language word \" fuck \". Its road signs were a popular visitor attraction and were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when they were modified to be theft-resistant. A campaign to change the village's name to Fugging was rejected in 2004 but succeeded in late 2020.  The settlement is believed to have been founded in the 6th century AD by Focko, a Bavarian nobleman. The Austrian region during this century was mostly under the domain of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths and was populated by a mix of Christians and pagans . The existence of the village was documented for the first time in 1070, and historical records show that some 20 years later, the lord was recorded in Latin as A...\n",
